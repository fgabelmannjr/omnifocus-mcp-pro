# Calendar API Implementation Specification Checklist

**Purpose**: Validates that Calendar/DateComponents API requirements are completely,
clearly, and consistently documented across all specification documents. This is a
**requirements quality gate** - ensuring the research conclusion (Calendar API MUST
be used) is enforceable through specification completeness.

**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Checklist Type**: Requirements Quality Validation
**Focus**: Calendar API date calculation specifications for Review System
**Actor**: Implementer/Reviewer
**Depth**: Comprehensive (release gate)

## Validation Notes

This checklist validates REQUIREMENTS QUALITY, not implementation behavior:

- Each item asks whether a requirement is DOCUMENTED, not whether code WORKS
- [Gap] markers identify missing requirements in pending documents
- [Consistency] markers identify cross-document alignment requirements
- [Clarity] markers identify ambiguous or vague specifications
- [Completeness] markers identify partial or missing specifications
- [Measurability] markers identify requirements that need concrete test values

**Pass Criteria**: All existing document items (CHK001-CHK084) should be satisfied.
Pending document items (CHK085-CHK092 [Gap, Pending]) become gates when those files are created.
